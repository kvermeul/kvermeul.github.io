I am Kevin Vermeulen, a full-time CNRS researcher at LAAS-CNRS, Toulouse, France.

I am interested in building networked measurement systems to better understand and improve the Internet.

In particular the systems and techniques that I develop are related to these different topics:

- Network topology
- Network performance
- Network security
- Traffic engineering

Before joining the CNRS, I was a postdoc at Columbia University working with professor [Ethan Katz-Bassett](http://www.columbia.edu/~ebk2141/).

I obtained my doctorate in 2020 under the supervision of professor Timur Friedman at Sorbonne Universit√©.

I am the maintainer of the [Reverse Traceroute](https://github.com/NEU-SNS/revtrvp) system. The system currently runs half a million reverse traceroute per day in coordination with the [M-Lab](https://www.measurementlab.net) NDT speedtests. The data are publicly available [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/archive-measurement-lab/autoload/v1/revtr;tab=objects?prefix=&forceOnObjectsSortingFiltering=false).
