### Note
In my domain of research on Internet measurements, the ACM Internet Measurement Conference (IMC) is the leading venue, with acceptance rates of around 25%. The PAM and TMA conferences are the other venues for Internet measurements, with higher acceptance rates. In the more general field of computer networks, the ACM SIGCOMM, USENIX NSDI, and ACM CoNEXT conferences are the leading venues with acceptance rates of around 20%. The ACM HotNets is the leading workshop for hot topics and new or controversial ideas in computer networks, with acceptance rates around 30%. IMC, SIGCOMM, and NSDI are classified as top conferences in their domain by the [csrankings.org](https://csrankings.org) website, which gives the top conferences of different domains of computer science according to researchers of the fields. 

These conferences and workshops are the best places to publish my work, although journals with excellent reputations exist, such as IEEE/ACM Transactions of Networking and ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review. Following the preferences of my research community, I tend to prefer publishing in the top conferences of my domain, that are as prestigious as the journals cited above and better for dissemination. Recently, CoNEXT publishes the long papers accepted at the conference in a journal, Proceedings of the ACM of Networking (PACMNET), so my CoNEXT long papers can be considered as journal publications.
